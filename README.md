## Background

UFO sightings have been observed since time immemorial where diverse civilisations have described strange, bizarre and occasionally phenomenal celestial events that are deemed paranormal. The purpose of this project was to provide access to records of UFO sightings that have occurred at different periods throughout the world so that users may obtain information on what kind of UFO sightings have been observed the descriptions that observers have provided. 

## Web Design

A website was designed in which to provide users with a list of all the UFO sightings that have occrred at different time periods and locations. In addition, the JavaScript language was utilised in which to provide users with an interactive experience wherein they have obtain information that is relevant to their queries, for instance, location, dates, countries or the perceived shape of the UFO. In addition, the website has been developed where any new sightings can be directly loaded into the Javascript array, sorted in chronological order and loaded onto the website. An example of the process has been provided below:

Two separate websites have been designed wherein the first site allows users to filter data based on dates whilst the second site allows users to filter based on dates, cities, country, state and/or shape of the UFO that was sighted.
